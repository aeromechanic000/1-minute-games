    <li><a href="pingpong.html" target="_blank">Ping Pong</a>: <b>Prompt</b> - Please use the P5.js framework to write a piece of code to create a black and white 2D style ping-pong game. The game should be set within a rectangular playing area.
<ol>
    <li> Game Elements:
        <ul> 
            <li> 
                Represent the ping-pong ball as a small white circle with a black outline.
                The ball should move across the screen with a certain speed and direction,
                which can change when it hits the walls or the paddles. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Create two ping-pong paddles. One paddle is controlled by the user 
                on one side of the playing area, and it can be represented as a long, 
                thin rectangle with a black fill and white outline. 
                The user should be able to move this paddle vertically using keyboard 
                controls (e.g., up and down arrow keys). 
            </li>
            <li> 
                The other paddle on the opposite side is controlled by the computer (PC). 
                It should also be a long, thin rectangle with a black fill and white outline,
                and its movement should be smooth and continuous as it automatically tries 
                to hit the ball back. The computer paddle's movement algorithm should be
                designed to predict the ball's trajectory and position itself appropriately. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> 
        Playing Area: The playing area is a large rectangle with a white background 
        and a black border. Divide the playing area into two halves with a black dashed 
        line in the middle to represent the net.
    </li>
    <li> 
        Scoring System: Implement a simple scoring system. When the ball goes out of bounds 
        on the opponent's side (either the computer's or the user's side), the other player
        scores a point. Display the scores of both the user and the computer at the top of 
        the playing area in black text.
    </li>
    <li>
        Buttons: Create two buttons: a "Start" button and a "Reset" button. 
        The "Start" button should be a rectangular shape with black text on a white
        background, and clicking it should start the game. 
        The "Reset" button should also be a rectangular shape with black text 
        on a white background, and clicking it should reset the game, 
        including the scores, the ball's position, and the paddles' positions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Interaction and Movement: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The ball's movement should be updated in each frame 
                of the game loop. When the ball hits a paddle, its direction should change 
                in a realistic way. When the ball hits the top or bottom walls of 
                the playing area, it should bounce off with the appropriate change 
                in direction.
            </li>
            <li>
                The user-controlled paddle should respond immediately to the keyboard input,
                moving smoothly within the boundaries of the playing area.
            </li>
            <li>
                The computer-controlled paddle should adjust its position in a continuous 
                and fluid manner to keep up with the ball's movement.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><a href="snakegame.html" target="_blank">Snake Game</a>: <b>Prompt</b> - Please use the P5.js framework to write a piece of code to create a classic 2D black - and - white style Ë¥™ÂêÉËõáÊ∏∏Êàè (Snake Game). The game should be set within a rectangular playing area.

<ol>
    <li> Game Elements:
        <ul> 
            <li> 
                Snake: Represent the snake as a series of connected small white squares with a black outline. 
                Each square represents a segment of the snake's body. The snake should start with a certain number of segments (e.g., 3) 
                and move across the screen in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. 
                The direction of the snake can be changed by the user using the keyboard controls 
                (e.g., up, down, left, and right arrow keys). 
            </li>
            <li>
                Food: Create a single small white square with a black outline to represent the food. 
                The food should be randomly placed within the playing area, but not on top of the snake's body. 
                When the snake's head collides with the food, the snake should grow by one segment, 
                and a new piece of food should be randomly placed within the playing area. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> 
        Playing Area: The playing area is a large rectangle with a white background and a black border. 
        The boundaries of the playing area define the limits within which the snake and the food can move.
    </li>
    <li> 
        Scoring System: Implement a simple scoring system. Every time the snake eats the food, 
        the player's score increases by 1. Display the score at the top of the playing area in black text.

    </li>
    <li>
        Buttons: Create two buttons: a "Start" button and a "Reset" button. The "Start" button should be a rectangular 
        shape with black text on a white background, and clicking it should start the game. 
        The "Reset" button should also be a rectangular shape with black text on a white background, 
        and clicking it should reset the game, including the score, the snake's position and length, and the position of the food.
    </li>
    <li>
        Interaction and Movement: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The snake's movement should be updated in each frame of the game loop. 
                The snake should move continuously in its current direction until the user changes its direction using the keyboard.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the snake's head collides with the boundaries of the playing area or its own body, 
                the game should end. Display a "Game Over" message in black text at the center of the playing area.
            </li>
            <li>
                 The food's position should remain fixed until the snake eats it, 
                 at which point a new random position should be generated for the food.
            </li>
        </ul>
